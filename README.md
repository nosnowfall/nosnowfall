Hi, and welcome.

I mostly write code for my own use, but maybe you'd like to use some of it too!
Feel free to use my code however you wish, adapt it to suit your needs, etc. If you spot a bug, want to suggest an improvement, or simply have question, please do let me know.

nosnowfall/nosnowfall is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
